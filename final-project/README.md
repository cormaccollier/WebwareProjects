# cs4241-FinalProject (Project-er)

Project-er is a project directory application where users can both post ideas for projects they have, as well
as find the next project they would like to work on. Often times people have great, ambitious ideas, but don't have all
the skills they need to execute their vision. Project-er allows users to create profiles with their skills and
interests and search for a project themselves, or get recommended projects based on their profile information. The same
users can also post ideas they have, and for the creative: they can write their own html to give a personalized touch to
their project's display page. Built into the application is a messaging component that allows users to contact
each other about potential projects, all through the site. The application currently supports only CS related projects
but the functionality is there to expand to other areas.
